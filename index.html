      <h2> Why attend this seminar?</h2>
      <p class = 'text'>How "specific" should movement assessments and exercise be to transfer to sport?</p>
      <p class = 'text'>Which measures of fitness, coordination, and variability are you using to inform exercise selection?</p>
      <p class='text'>How are you integrating motor learning principles in your assessments and program design?</p>
      <p class= 'text'>Answers to these questions, and much more, will be expanded upon in live lectures and Q&As over Zoom! </p>
