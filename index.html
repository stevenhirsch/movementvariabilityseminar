      <h2> Why attend this seminar?</h2>
      <p class = 'text'> How specific should assessments and training be to transfer to sport? Which measures of fitness, coordination, and variability are you using to inform training? How are you integrating motor learning principles in your assessments and program design?</p>
      <p class= 'text'> Answers to these questions, and much more, will be expanded upon across two days of information-packed, live webinars. </p>
